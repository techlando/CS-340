Client/Server Development

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code starts with clear abstractions and consistent organization. In Project One, I encapsulated every database operation—create, read, update, delete—behind well-named functions in a single Python module. That separation meant that when I built each dashboard widget in Project Two, I simply imported the function I needed instead of rewriting connection logic or raw queries. As a result, updating authentication details or tweaking error handling required changes in only one place. In the future, I can reuse this same module in command-line tools, web services, or other dashboards by importing it and passing in different parameters, which eliminates duplicated code and speeds up development

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I start by clarifying the client’s goals and sketching a data model before touching any code. For Grazioso Salvare, I mapped out collections, key fields, and indexes on paper first, which helped me anticipate how queries would perform on thousands of records. Then I broke the work into small steps and built apon each step. This hands-on, approach marked a shift from earlier courses where I sometimes dove straight into code. Going forward, I’ll continue using incremental development with live feedback, and clear documentation of each collection schema to ensure every database design is both scalable and aligned with the client’s needs.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists turn raw data into actionable insights through modeling, algorithms, and abstraction. By rigorously designing data schemas and queries, they build systems that reliably surface trends and patterns. In the Grazioso Salvare project, my work transformed thousands of animal outcome records into real-time charts and tables, giving stakeholders an immediate view into intake trends, adoption rates, and geographic distributions. Automating those reports at the database layer and visualizing them in a dashboard empowers the team to make faster, data-driven decisions, reduce manual reporting overhead, and focus their efforts on improving animal welfare and operational efficiency.
